<p>I am a 5th year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Laboratory</a>, University of Cambridge (affiliated with Corpus Christi College), supervised by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/">Professor Jon Crowcroft</a>. I have just passed my PhD viva and currently is looking for job opportunities.</p>

<p>I am interested in various research topics, including numerical computation, edge computing, machine learning, neural networks, and their application in the real world. 
I have been actively participating in the development of <a href="https://ocaml.xyz/">Owl</a>, an scientific computing library that is widely used in the <a href="https://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> community, as a main developer. Currently I focus on developing a <a href="https://github.com/owlbarn/owl_symbolic">symbolic</a> library based on Owl, and am leading Owlâ€™s <a href="https://ocaml.xyz/owl_tutorials/">tutorial book</a>.</p>

<p>I am always glad to face new challenges. I have been practising Kendo in the <a href="http://kendo.soc.srcf.net/membership/borrowing/">University of Cambridge Kendo Society</a> for three years. 
I have also participated in the <a href="https://stimulus.maths.org/">STIMULUS programme</a> as volunteer to assist teaching computer science to pupils in local schools.</p>
