I am a Post-doc working at the Cooperative Autonomous Systems Groups of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I acquired my PhD at the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge (affiliated with Corpus Christi College), supervised by [Professor Jon Crowcroft](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/).

I am interested in using scientific computation methods in real-world applications, e.g. autonomous driving, for performance optimization. Such methods vary from basic integration / linear algebra / statistics to advanced numerical methods such as algorithmic differentiation, optimization, regression, deep learning, etc. I'm interested in how application performance can be improved on various levels: from cache and tile optimization on CPU/GPU hardware to computation graph management and then to the collaboration among swarm of edge computation devices.  It is always exciting to see how theoretical research can be utilized to achive signficant optimization and impact in real-world industries. 
I have been actively participating in the development of [Owl](https://ocaml.xyz/), a scientific computing library that is widely used as the de-facto numerical library in the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) community, as a main developer and now as project leader. 

I am always glad to face new challenges. I have been practising Kendo in the [University of Cambridge Kendo Society](http://kendo.soc.srcf.net/) for three years. 
I have also participated in the [STIMULUS programme](https://stimulus.maths.org/) as volunteer to assist teaching computer science to pupils in local schools.
