I am a 5th year PhD student at the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, supervised by [Professor Jon Crowcroft](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/). I have interest in numerical computation and have been participating in the development of [Owl](https://ocaml.xyz/), an OCaml-based scientific computing library. Currently I focus on developing a [symbolic](https://github.com/owlbarn/owl_symbolic) library based on Owl, and writing Owl's [tutorial book](https://ocaml.xyz/owl_tutorials/).
