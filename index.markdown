I am a 5th year PhD student at the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge (affiliated with Corpus Christi College), supervised by [Professor Jon Crowcroft](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/). I have passed my PhD viva.

I am interested in various research topics, including numerical computation, high performance computing, machine learning, and their application in the real world. 
I have been actively participating in the development of [Owl](https://ocaml.xyz/), a scientific computing library that is widely used in the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) community, as a main developer. Currently I focus on developing a [symbolic](https://github.com/owlbarn/owl_symbolic) library based on Owl, and leading Owl's [tutorial book](https://ocaml.xyz/book/).

I am always glad to face new challenges. I have been practising Kendo in the [University of Cambridge Kendo Society](http://kendo.soc.srcf.net/) for three years. 
I have also participated in the [STIMULUS programme](https://stimulus.maths.org/) as volunteer to assist teaching computer science to pupils in local schools.
